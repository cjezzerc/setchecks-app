<h1>Terms and Conditions for the VSMT Setchecks (Proof of Concept)</h1>

<h2>
Scope
</h2>
<p>
This application is limited to allowing a user to upload a value set, 
and providing an outcome report, based on a range of 13 pre-defined Set Checks. 
</p>
<p style="color:#EE0000; font-weight: bold;">
    IMPORTANT: All outputs should be reviewed and approved by relevantly qualified clinical professionals before changes are made to any value set being used to record or assess care data.
</p>
<h2>
Limitations
</h2>
<p>
The application is developed for use in Health & Care settings within the UK, and therefore makes use of published releases of the SNOMED CT UK Edition only. The inclusion of any SNOMED Components that are not within a release of the SNOMED CT UK Edition in your value set may prevent the full suite of Set Checks being completed.
</p>
<p>
The application is running on restricted cloud resources, 
and as such the performance of the tool to handle multiple simultaneous users 
is an important aspect of evaluating this implementation. 
This PoC places a limit on the size of an uploaded file (currently 3000 concepts). 
Files towards the upper end of this range may impact the performance of the tool.
</p>
<h2>
Licencing
</h2>
<p>
By using this PoC, you accept the licence agreement for the use of SNOMED CT, which is available on <a href="https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/licence/10" target="_blank"> TRUD</a>.

<h2>
